# Image recognition with  <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow.js</a>

## Usage:

### Instruction for users

If you would like use it and you don't need any code change you might see it on my <a href="https://mikhama.github.io/image-recognition/" target="_blank">gh-pages</a>.

### Instruction for developers

If you need to see into this code and understand how it works then fork this repo and have fun!

If you have `live-server` installed, you can only run `live-server` directly in `client` folder.

Another way to start server is:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
