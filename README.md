# Image recognition with  <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow.js</a>

## Usage:

### Instruction for users

If you would like use it and you don't need any code change you might see it on my <a href="https://mikhama.github.io/image-recognition/">gh-pages</a>.

### Instruction for developers

If you need to see into this code and understand how it works then fork this repo and have fun!

If you have `live-server` installed, you can only run `live-server` directly in `client` folder.

Another way to start server is:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

I also recommend read this <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/get-to-know-tensorflow-js-in-7-minutes-afcd0dfd3d2f">article</a> in order to understand how to work with TensorFlow.js.

### Note

This demo application uses some ES7 features like async-functions. And it might not work in some browsers, such as browsers for mobile, old browsers, etc.
